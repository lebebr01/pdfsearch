\usage{
heading_search(
  x,
  headings,
  path = FALSE,
  pdf_toc = FALSE,
  full_line = FALSE,
  ignore_case = FALSE,
  split_pdf = FALSE,
  convert_sentence = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Either the text of the pdf read in with the pdftools package or a 
path for the location of the pdf file.}

\item{headings}{A character vector representing the headings to search for.
Can be NULL if pdf_toc = TRUE.}

\item{path}{An optional path designation for the location of the pdf to be 
converted to text. The pdftools package is used for this conversion.}

\item{pdf_toc}{TRUE/FALSE whether the pdf_toc function should be used from
the \code{\link{pdftools}} package. This is most useful if the pdf has 
the table of contents embedded within the pdf.
Must specify path = TRUE if pdf_toc = TRUE.}

\item{full_line}{TRUE/FALSE indicating whether the headings should reside on
their own line. This can create problems with multiple column pdfs.}

\item{ignore_case}{TRUE/FALSE/vector of TRUE/FALSE, indicating whether the 
case of the keyword matters. 
Default is FALSE meaning that case of the headings keywords are literal. 
If a vector, must be same length as the headings vector.}

\item{split_pdf}{TRUE/FALSE indicating whether to split the pdf using white 
space. This would be most useful with multicolumn pdf files. 
The split_pdf function attempts to recreate the column layout of the text 
into a single column starting with the left column and proceeding to the 
right.}

\item{convert_sentence}{TRUE/FALSE indicating if individual lines of PDF file
should be collapsed into a single large paragraph to perform keyword 
searching. Default is FALSE}
