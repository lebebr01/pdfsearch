\arguments{
\item{x}{Either the text of the pdf read in with the pdftools package or a 
path for the location of the pdf file.}

\item{keyword}{The keyword(s) to be used to search in the text. Multiple 
keywords can be specified with a character vector.}

\item{path}{An optional path designation for the location of the pdf to be 
converted to text. The pdftools package is used for this conversion.}

\item{surround_lines}{numeric/FALSE indicating whether the output should 
extract the surrounding lines of text in addition to the matching line. 
Default is FALSE, if not false, include a numeric number that indicates 
the additional number of surrounding lines that will be extracted.}

\item{ignore_case}{TRUE/FALSE/vector of TRUE/FALSE, indicating whether the 
case of the keyword matters. Default is FALSE meaning that case of the 
keyword is literal. If a vector, must be same length as the keyword 
vector.}

\item{token_results}{TRUE/FALSE indicating whether the results text returned
should be split into tokens. See the tokenizers package and 
\code{\link{convert_tokens}} for more details. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{heading_search}{TRUE/FALSE indicating whether to search for headings 
in the pdf.}

\item{heading_args}{A list of arguments to pass on to the 
\code{\link{heading_search}} function. See \code{\link{heading_search}} 
 for more details on arguments needed.}

\item{split_pdf}{TRUE/FALSE indicating whether to split the pdf using white 
space. This would be most useful with multicolumn pdf files. 
The split_pdf function attempts to recreate the column layout of the text 
into a single column starting with the left column and proceeding to the 
right.}

\item{blank_lines}{TRUE/FALSE indicating whether blank text lines should
be removed. Default is TRUE.}

\item{remove_hyphen}{TRUE/FALSE indicating whether hyphenated words should
be adjusted to combine onto a single line. Default is TRUE.}

\item{convert_sentence}{TRUE/FALSE indicating if individual lines of PDF file
should be collapsed into a single large paragraph to perform keyword 
searching. Default is TRUE}

\item{remove_equations}{TRUE/FALSE indicating if equations should be removed.
Default behavior is to search for a literal parenthesis,
followed by at least one number followed by another parenthesis at
the end of the text line. This will not detect other patterns or
detect the entire equation if it is a multi-row equation.}

\item{split_pattern}{Regular expression pattern used to split multicolumn 
PDF files using \code{stringi::stri_split_regex}. 
Default pattern is to 
split based on three or more consecutive white space characters.}

\item{split_method}{Method used for splitting multicolumn PDF text.
Defaults to "regex". Use "coordinates" to split with
\code{pdftools::pdf_data()} token coordinates.}

\item{column_count}{Expected number of columns for coordinate splitting.
Options are "auto", "1", or "2". Used when
\code{split_method = "coordinates"}.}

\item{mask_nonprose}{TRUE/FALSE indicating if non-prose lines (likely
equations, tables, figure/table captions) should be removed when
using coordinate splitting.}

\item{nonprose_digit_ratio}{Numeric threshold for classifying a line as
non-prose based on digit character ratio.}

\item{nonprose_symbol_ratio}{Numeric threshold for classifying a line as
non-prose based on math-symbol character ratio.}

\item{nonprose_short_token_max}{Maximum token count for short symbolic
lines to classify as non-prose.}

\item{remove_section_headers}{TRUE/FALSE indicating if section-header-like
lines should be removed when using coordinate splitting.}

\item{remove_page_headers}{TRUE/FALSE indicating if page-header furniture
(e.g., arXiv identifiers, emails, URLs) should be removed when using
coordinate splitting.}

\item{remove_page_footers}{TRUE/FALSE indicating if page-footer furniture
(e.g., page numbers, copyright markers) should be removed when using
coordinate splitting.}

\item{page_margin_ratio}{Numeric ratio used to define top and bottom page
bands for header/footer removal.}

\item{remove_repeated_furniture}{TRUE/FALSE indicating if repeated text
found in the first/last lines across many pages should be removed.}

\item{repeated_edge_n}{Number of lines from top and bottom of each page to
consider for repeated edge-line detection.}

\item{repeated_edge_min_pages}{Minimum number of pages an edge line must
appear on before being removed.}

\item{remove_captions}{TRUE/FALSE indicating if figure/table caption lines
should be removed.}

\item{caption_continuation_max}{Number of additional lines after a caption
start line to remove when they appear to be caption continuations.}

\item{table_mode}{How to handle detected table blocks. "keep" keeps all
lines, "remove" excludes table blocks, and "only" keeps only table
blocks.}

\item{table_min_numeric_tokens}{Minimum numeric tokens used to classify a
line as table-like.}

\item{table_min_digit_ratio}{Minimum digit-character ratio used to classify
a line as table-like.}

\item{table_min_block_lines}{Minimum number of adjacent table-like lines for
a block to be treated as a table block.}

\item{table_block_max_gap}{Maximum gap (in lines) allowed between
table-like lines inside one table block.}

\item{table_include_headers}{TRUE/FALSE indicating if table header lines
adjacent to detected table blocks should be included in table blocks.}

\item{table_header_lookback}{Number of lines above a detected table block to
inspect for header rows.}

\item{table_include_notes}{TRUE/FALSE indicating if trailing note/source
lines should be included with detected table blocks.}

\item{table_note_lookahead}{Number of lines after a detected table block to
inspect for note/source rows.}

\item{concatenate_pages}{TRUE/FALSE indicating if page text should be
concatenated after column rectification and cleaning, before sentence
conversion. This is only used when \code{convert_sentence = TRUE}.}

\item{...}{token_function to pass to \code{\link{convert_tokens}} 
function.}
}
\value{
A tibble data frame that contains the keyword, location of match, 
  the line of text match, and optionally the tokens associated with the line
  of text match.
}
\description{
This uses the pdf_text from the pdftools package to perform keyword searches. 
Keyword locations indicating the line of the text as well as the page number 
that the keyword is found are returned.
