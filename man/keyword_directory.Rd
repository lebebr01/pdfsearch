  directory,
  keyword,
  split_pdf = FALSE,

  remove_hyphen = TRUE,
  token_results = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{directory}{The directory to perform the search for pdf files to search.}

\item{keyword}{The keyword(s) to be used to search in the text. Multiple 
keywords can be specified with a character vector.}

\item{split_pdf}{TRUE/FALSE indicating whether to split the pdf using white 
space. This would be most useful with multicolumn pdf files. 
The split_pdf function attempts to recreate the column layout of the text 
into a single column starting with the left column and proceeding to the 
right.}

\item{surround_lines}{numeric/FALSE indicating whether the output should 
extract the surrouding lines of text in addition to the matching line. 
Default is FALSE, if not false, include a numeric number that indicates 
the additional number of surrounding lines that will be extracted.}

\item{ignore_case}{TRUE/FALSE/vector of TRUE/FALSE, indicating whether the 
case of the keyword matters. 
Default is FALSE meaning that case of the keyword is literal. If a vector, 
must be same length as the keyword vector.}

\item{remove_hyphen}{TRUE/FALSE indicating whether hyphenated words should
be adjusted to combine onto a single line. Default is TRUE.}

\item{token_results}{TRUE/FALSE indicating whether the results text returned
should be split into tokens. See the tokenizers package and 
\code{\link{convert_tokens}} for more details. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{convert_sentence}{TRUE/FALSE indicating if individual lines of PDF file
should be collapsed into a single large paragraph to perform keyword 
searching. Default is TRUE.}

\item{remove_equations}{TRUE/FALSE indicating if equations should be removed.
Default behavior is to search for the following regex:
"\\([0-9]{1,}\\)$", essentially this matches a literal parenthesis,
followed by at least one number followed by another parenthesis at
the end of the text line. This will not detect other patterns or
detect the entire equation if it is a multi-row equation.}

\item{split_pattern}{Regular expression pattern used to split multicolumn 
PDF files using \code{stringi::stri_split_regex}. 
Default pattern is "\\p{WHITE_SPACE}{3,}" which can be interpreted as: 
split based on three or more consecutive white space characters.}

\item{full_names}{TRUE/FALSE indicating if the full file path should be used.
Default is TRUE, see \code{\link{list.files}} for more details.}

\item{file_pattern}{An optional regular expression to select specific file
names. Only files that match the regular expression will be searched. 
Defaults to all pdfs, i.e. \code{".pdf"}. See \code{\link{list.files}} 
for more details.}

\item{recursive}{TRUE/FALSE indicating if subdirectories should be searched 
as well.
Default is FALSE, see \code{\link{list.files}} for more details.}

\item{max_search}{An optional numeric vector indicating the maximum number
of pdfs to search. Will only search the first n cases.}

\item{...}{token_function to pass to \code{\link{convert_tokens}} 
function.}
}
\value{
A tibble data frame that contains the keyword, location of match, 
  the line of text match, and optionally the tokens associated with the line
  of text match. The output is combined (row binded) for all pdf input files.
}
\description{
This will use the keyword_search function to loop over all pdf files in a 
directory. Includes the ability to include subdirectories as well.
}
\examples{
# find directory
directory <- system.file('pdf', package = 'pdfsearch')

# do search over two files
keyword_directory(directory, 
       keyword = c('repeated measures', 'measurement error'),
       surround_lines = 1, full_names = TRUE)
       
# can also split pdfs
keyword_directory(directory, 
       keyword = c('repeated measures', 'measurement error'),
       split_pdf = TRUE, remove_hyphen = FALSE,
       surround_lines = 1, full_names = TRUE)
